\section{Algorithm and Organization}
In this section, we describe the algorithm choices and the organization of testing routines and subroutines.

\subsection{Algorithm Choices}
The LU factorization code utilizes the following algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item LU decomposition algorithm for generating unit lower triangular matrix $L$ and nonsingular upper triangular matrix $U$.
    \item Matrix-vector multiplication for computing $Lv$ and $Us$.
    \item Triangular system solvers for solving $Ly = b$ and $Ux = y$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Organization of Testing Routines}
The testing routines are organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generation of random matrices $L$ and $U$ along with vectors $v$, $s$, $b$, and $x$ for testing.
    \item Validation against known analytical solutions for smaller cases.
    \item Comparison with results from library routines, e.g., MATLAB functions.
    \item Assessment of correctness through absolute and relative errors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimized Storage for $L$ and $U$}
In the LU factorization code, an optimization strategy was employed to enhance the storage efficiency of the lower triangular matrix $L$ and upper triangular matrix $U$. Instead of utilizing dense matrices with explicit storage for zeros, a dictionary-based representation was chosen.

For each matrix $L$ and $U$, only the non-zero entries were stored as key-value pairs, where the keys represented the matrix indices, and the values corresponded to the non-zero elements. This approach significantly reduced memory usage for matrices with many zero entries, resulting in a more compact representation.

The dictionaries were constructed dynamically during the LU decomposition process, adding entries only for elements with non-zero values. This optimization is particularly beneficial when dealing with large matrices where the majority of entries are zero.

This storage optimization not only reduces memory requirements but also contributes to computational efficiency, as operations involving these sparse matrices only consider the explicitly stored non-zero elements.

The following code snippet illustrates the dynamic construction of $L$ and $U$ dictionaries:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Python code for generating $L$ and $U$]
    def L_gen(n):
        lower_triangular_matrix = {}
        for i in range(n):
            lower_triangular_matrix[(i, i)] = 1
            for j in range(i):
                value = random.randint(0, 10)
                if value != 0:
                    lower_triangular_matrix[(i, j)] = value
        return lower_triangular_matrix
    
    def U_gen(n):
        upper_triangular_matrix = {}
        for i in range(n):
            upper_triangular_matrix[(i, i)] = random.randint(-10, 10)
            while upper_triangular_matrix[(i, i)] == 0:
                upper_triangular_matrix[(i, i)] = random.randint(-10, 10)
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                value = random.randint(0, 10)
                if value != 0:
                    upper_triangular_matrix[(i, j)] = value
        return upper_triangular_matrix
    \end{lstlisting}

\section{Validation Strategies}
This section describes the strategies employed for validation.

\subsection{Problem Generation}
Random matrices $L$ and $U$ are generated along with vectors $v$, $s$, $b$, and $x$. The generation process ensures the absence of NaN or Inf values.

\subsection{Range of Problem Sizes}
The LU factorization code is tested over a range of problem sizes, from $n=10$ to $n=200$, to assess scalability and performance.

\subsection{Correctness Evaluation}
Correctness is evaluated through the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparison with analytical solutions for smaller cases.
    \item Comparison with results from well-established library routines.
    \item Examination of absolute and relative errors for larger cases.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Information Displayed}
The evaluation section displays:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Absolute and relative errors for each problem size.
    \item Histograms of relative errors to visualize error distribution.
    \item Trend analysis of errors with increasing problem size.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evidence of Correctness}
In this section, we present evidence of correctness based on the results obtained.

\subsubsection{Scalability and Performance}
The LU factorization code demonstrates scalability, as evidenced by the consistent behavior in mean relative errors across a range of problem sizes.
